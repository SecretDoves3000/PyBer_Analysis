# Analysis of Ride Sharing Data by City Type for PyBer
## Overview 
  In this analysis we look at ride sharing data from the first half of 2019 broken down by the primary housing type of the city in which the ride takes place: urban, surburban, or rural. This data can be used to make regional pricing decisions to maximize revenue and/or market share as is pertinent to the buisness strategy at a given time. 

## Results
We present two summary graphics: 
- a summary table of the data grouped by city type: ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecretDoves3000/PyBer_Analysis/main/Resources/Pyber_summary_dataframe.png)
- a line graph of total fare by city type over the first four months of 2019: ![] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecretDoves3000/PyBer_Analysis/main/analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

From our summary table, we can see that, unsurprisingly, urban enviroments have a higher total fare than suburban areas, and suburban areas have higher total fares than rural. The average fares, however, actually follow the reverse order, with rural having the highest average fare both per ride and per driver, followed by suburban and then urban far below. 

Looking at our line graph, we see that the total fare ordering of the regions is stable over time, and in fact, the total fare is generally stable over time, varying essentially at random centered on the average total fare.

## 
Looking at our summary table, while urban environments are the most lucrative, this does not stem from higher prices, but rather a much larger userbase. As such, we can confidently suggest trying lower regional prices for urban environments. While this may seem counterintuitive, there is apparently enough urban demand to support a lower price, while still sustaining revenue, and if the price was lowered, this could allow PyBer to seize a significant market share in this lucrative region.

Also, we see that we can expect revenue to be stable region to region over time, and so, even if there is a temporary dip for one reason or another, we advise against any short term focused revenue strategies which may have a longer term negative impact on the average revenue for a reason. Fluctuations in the revenue streams of fares are to be expected, and should be built into the businesses budgetting plans.
